# 📊 Video-Game-Sales-Analysis

## 📌 Overview
Guided Project on analysis of video game sales trends from 1980 to 2016

In CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Certification Program, they have a guided project where you act as an analyst for a ficticious stakeholder called GameCo.
They provided a prompt, from which point, you would be given a dataset that would need to be cleaned, explored, and analyzed. 
From there, you would present your findings and insights on PowerPoint, and this guided project serves as an introduction to data analyst practices.
This is a recreation of the analysis that would be performed in the guided project with a similar dataset originating from Kaggle.
